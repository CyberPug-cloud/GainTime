# Reward Concept

## Overview
This document outlines the customizable reward system for the Cursor AI program. In this system, all reward levels and the goal reward are defined by the user. The system is designed to motivate users to achieve a significant goal by incrementally adding user-defined reward amounts to a common pool as they progress in their habit formation.

## System Components

### 1. Main Prize
- **Definition:** A major reward (e.g., a vacation) whose cost is specified by the user.
- **User Input:**  
  - **Main Prize Name:** The desired goal (e.g., "Trip to Hawaii").
  - **Main Prize Cost:** The total cost required to claim the prize (user-defined value).

### 2. Reward Levels
All reward levels are fully customizable by the user:

#### Reward Level 1 (Daily Reward)
- **Condition:** Completion of all planned daily habits.
- **Reward Amount:** User-specified (e.g., 10 PLN per day).

#### Reward Level 2 (Weekly Reward)
- **Condition:** Daily completion of habits for 7 consecutive days.
- **Reward Amount:** User-specified (e.g., 100 PLN per week).

#### Reward Level 3 (Monthly Reward)
- **Condition:** Daily completion of habits for 30 consecutive days.
- **Reward Amount:** User-specified (e.g., 500 PLN per month).

### 3. Goal Reward (Final Target Reward)
- **Definition:** A special reward granted when a specific habit goal is achieved.
- **Condition:** For example, achieving the target of reading 20 pages daily for 2 months.
- **Reward Amount:** User-specified (e.g., 2000 PLN).

## Workflow

1. **Setup:**  
   - **Main Prize Configuration:** The user defines the main prize by entering its name and cost.
   - **Habit Definition:** The user sets up the habits they want to develop and configures the conditions for each reward level as well as the goal reward.

2. **Execution:**  
   - **Daily Reward (Level 1):** Awarded each day when all daily habits are completed.
   - **Weekly Reward (Level 2):** Awarded after maintaining a 7-day streak of habit completion.
   - **Monthly Reward (Level 3):** Awarded after maintaining a 30-day streak.
   - **Goal Reward:** Awarded upon reaching a user-defined final target for a habit.

3. **Accumulation:**  
   - All rewards accumulate in a central pool.
   - When the total pool reaches or exceeds the user-defined cost of the main prize, the user qualifies to claim the main prize.

## Integration with Cursor AI
- **Modular Attachment:** The reward system is designed to be easily integrated into the Cursor AI program.
- **User Configuration:** Users can input and modify reward parameters (amounts and conditions) directly within the app.
- **Notifications & Tracking:**  
  - The system provides real-time feedback on progress.
  - Notifications inform the user when a reward is added and when they approach the main prize threshold.

## Example Scenario
- **Main Prize:** "Trip to Hawaii" with a user-defined cost of 20,000 PLN.
- **Reward Level 1 (Daily):** 10 PLN for completing daily habits.
- **Reward Level 2 (Weekly):** 100 PLN after 7 consecutive days.
- **Reward Level 3 (Monthly):** 500 PLN after 30 consecutive days.
- **Goal Reward:** 2000 PLN for reaching a specific habit target (e.g., reading 20 pages daily for 2 months).
- **Outcome:** As rewards are accumulated, the pool grows until the total meets or exceeds the cost of the main prize, at which point the user can claim their reward.

## Conclusion
This customizable reward system empowers users to tailor their motivational incentives by setting their own reward amounts and conditions. Its integration with Cursor AI allows for a seamless and dynamic experience that enhances habit formation and drives progress toward significant, user-defined goals.
